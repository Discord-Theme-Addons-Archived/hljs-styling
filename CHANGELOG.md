# v0.1.0d
For those who actually use this, you may be wondering why this isn't v1.0.0 anyomre and what's going on.. I've taken it upon myself to redo this thing in it's entirety and do it **properly**. What I mean by "properly" is that everything should appear as how it does on https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/, tho given that Discord has messed up in some areas with the classes. 

It's going to be a while until the release of v1.0.0.. if you take a look at `./src/_root.scss` you can see why (and stupid I am). Yes, I know there's probably an easier way to go about doing this. No, I don't know what way that is. 

It's going to be a good while before other styles are released as well. Feel free to make a PR adding those specific styles ,tho i recommend you begin working on them after v1.0.0 cause mostly everything will be good to go. Please bare with me as my shriveled up braincells are crying for help and pleaing to take a break.

For now, here are all the actual changes:
- All global variables should be done, might have to change stuff around in the future depending on if I actually got it done correclty.
- Better specific coloring on some things so it can get as close as possible to the original theme.
- Redid the repo, looks nicer doesn't it?
- Vizlaity, BetterDiscord and Web support is coming soon (aka v1.0.0 release).

TL;DR: Working to make this better than before, and not something simplistic. Thank you for your patience aka the 3 people who use this.
