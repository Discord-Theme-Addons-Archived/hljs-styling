# HLJS Styling
Gives customization to Discord's default codeblocks. Colors are based off of the [Highlight JS Demo](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/).
- Please be warned that if you want to create a specific style of your own, it's going to be a pain. If you successfully create a style, feel free to make a pull request adding it to the styles folder.

On Powercord & Vizality, you can simple change the import to use the specific styles located in the `./styles` folder. On BetterDiscord & Web, you will have to replace what's inside of the root.
- If you want a specific style, however it isn't available, you are free to make an issue on this repo suggesting that style.
